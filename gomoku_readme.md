## Technical Architecture

### Core AI Implementation

The AI engine implements a classic minimax search with several optimizations:

```javascript
minimax(depth, isMaximizing, alpha, beta) {
    if (depth === 0) return this.evaluateBoard();
    
    if (isMaximizing) {
        let maxScore = -Infinity;
        for (const move of this.getViableMoves().slice(0, 10)) {
            this.board[move.row][move.col] = this.aiPlayer;
            const score = this.minimax(depth - 1, false, alpha, beta);
            this.board[move.row][move.col] = 0;
            
            maxScore = Math.max(score, maxScore);
            alpha = Math.max(alpha, score);
            if (beta <= alpha) break; // Alpha-beta pruning
        }
        return maxScore;
    }
    // Similar logic for minimizing player...
}
```

### Strategic Evaluation Function

The position evaluation considers multiple strategic factors:

```javascript
evaluateDirection(row, col, dr, dc, player) {
    // Pattern scoring based on:
    // - Consecutive stones (count)
    // - Open ends vs blocked ends  
    // - Threat potential and forcing moves
    
    if (count >= 4) return 10000;      // Immediate win
    if (count === 3 && blocked === 0) return 1000;  // Open three
    if (count === 3 && blocked === 1) return 100;   // Semi-open three
    // ... additional pattern recognition
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Move Ordering**: Prioritizes high-value moves to improve pruning effectiveness
2. **Neighbor Filtering**: Only considers moves within 2 squares of existing stones
3. **Early Win Detection**: Separate fast path for immediate win/block scenarios
4. **Depth-Limited Search**: Configurable search depth based on difficulty level

## Algorithm Complexity

| Component | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Minimax (base) | O(b^d) | O(d) |
| With Alpha-Beta | O(b^(d/2)) | O(d) |
| Position Evaluation | O(1) | O(1) |
| Move Generation | O(nÂ²) | O(nÂ²) |

Where:
- `b` = branching factor (~10-15 viable moves per position)
- `d` = search depth (2-4 levels depending on difficulty)
- `n` = board size (15x15)

## Game Theory Implementation

### Strategic Concepts
- **Zugzwang**: Recognizing when opponent must make disadvantageous moves
- **Tempo Control**: Maintaining initiative through forcing sequences
- **Space Advantage**: Evaluating territorial control and expansion potential
- **Threat Hierarchy**: Prioritizing immediate threats over positional advantages

### Pattern Recognition
The AI recognizes key Gomoku patterns:
- **Five-in-a-Row**: Winning condition detection
- **Open Four**: Unstoppable winning threats
- **Double Three**: Fork attacks creating multiple threats
- **Blocked Patterns**: Defensive position evaluation

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Serve the HTML file with any web server
python -m http.server 8000
# Navigate to http://localhost:8000/gomoku_final_clean.html
```

### Game Configuration
- **Beginner**: 2-depth minimax, basic evaluation
- **Intermediate**: 3-depth search, enhanced pattern recognition  
- **Advanced**: 4-depth search, full strategic evaluation

### Integration Ready
The game engine can be easily extracted for integration:
```javascript
// Standalone AI move calculation
const bestMove = game.getBestMove();
game.makeMove(bestMove.row, bestMove.col, aiPlayer);

// Position evaluation for external analysis  
const boardScore = game.evaluateBoard();
```

## Technical Specifications
